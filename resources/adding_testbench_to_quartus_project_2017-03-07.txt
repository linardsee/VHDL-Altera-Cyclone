Step by step - creating testbench for module ENTITY_NAME (unit under test)

1) Create new VHDL file (File - New - VHDL File) and save it in project directory with name "ENTITY_NAME_tb.vhd"

2) Copy testbench template contents to the new file

2) Fill the testbench template - replace the entity names where required, defining signals, generating clock, generating stimulus signals, etc.

3) Tell Quartus which testbench file to run after Analysis and Synthesis
3a) Select Assignments - Settings to open project settings.
3b) Select radio button Compile Testbench in "Simulation" category, and click on button "Test Benches..." in NativeLink settings
3c) Click on "New..." - a "New Test Bench Settings" window should open
3d) Fill "Test bench name" and "Top level module in test bench" with  "ENTITY_NAME_tb" or the one you used in testbench file!
3e) optional - select simulation period as desired
3f) Select the testbench file by clicking "..." and choose the "ENTITY_NAME_tb.vhd" file, then click ADD
3g) Click Ok, this will close "New Test Bench Settings" window.
3h) Select the new test bench in the list and click Ok. You can add more than one test bench file for simulations, but the selected one will be called later.


4) Run Analysis and Synthesis

5) To start simulation, click Tools - Run Simulation Tool - RTL Simulation. ModelSim-Altera software should now open and automatically run the testbench selected in step 3).
